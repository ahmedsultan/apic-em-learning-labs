# APIC-EM REST API Part 3 - Policy labs

## Objectives

* Learn about Policy based APIC-EM APIs and how to use them.
* Write custom scripts using Python.


## Prerequisites
* This lab uses APIC-EM release 1.3 or later.
* Python version 3.x is required to run sample scripts.
* If you are not familiar with Python, start with Part I - The Basics.
* If you are familiar with Python, start with Part II.


## Get started

If you are using Cisco-provided hardware at a Cisco event:

*  Lab files are in the directory: `C:\apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\policy-labs`
*  Create your working directory by entering `mkdir \apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\policy-labs\<UniqueName>`.<br><br>

If you are working from your computer, follow these steps:

*  Install Python 3 and Git on your computer. See **How To Set up Your Computer** at the top of this page.
*  Download and install Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
*  Download the lab files from GitHub, then enter:

 ```
 cd <your working directory>
 ```

If you are in the DevNet Zone at a Cisco Live Event, open the Git Command window. Do one of the following:
*  Click the Git Command icon on the Taskbar.
*  Type `git cmd` in the Run bar.  

In the Git Command window enter the following command:

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes
 ```
 After the `git clone` completes, you have all of the Python files needed for this lab.

*  If you are not at a Cisco event, to run the Python scripts, you must set the `ip` variable to the IP address of the Cisco APIC-EM controller that you want the scripts to call. This variable is in the `apicem_config.py` file.<br>

For example:

 ```
 ip = 'https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com'
 ```

## Execute lab examples

To run the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and change to the directory that contains the learning lab sample code. Typically, your working directory is: `\apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\policy-labs`

2. Invoke Python3:
  * On macOS or Linux, enter: `python3 <programName>`<br>
  * On Windows, enter: `py â€“3 <programName>` or `python <programName>` <br>


> Alternatively, you can use the Python IDE, IDLE, as follows:
On a Mac, in a terminal, type `idle3` to open IDLE for Python3.
On Windows, start IDLE from the Start menu. See the following figure.

## Step 1: Understand EasyQoS and related APIs
As in previous sessions, all Python sample scripts are run in a flat directory. The file `apicem\_config.py` is normally used to configure parameters for different environments. Those parameters are the APIC-EM IP (including port number), username, password, and the apic-em API version number. When you use your APIC-EM, this is the file you need to modify. Every script must import `apicem.py`.<br>

For this step, however, you use apicem.py differently. You will turn it into an object, create a `class` called `apicem`, then turn all functions into methods of the `apicem` object.<br>


**apicem.py script:**

import requests   # Use Python external `requests` module to perform HTTP queries

### All APIC-EM configuration is in apicem_config.py
import apicem_config  # Assign APIC-EM IP in apicem_config.py from tabulate
import tabulate # Pretty-print tabular data in Python

requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings() # Disable warning message
* Gets rid of certificate warning messages when using Python 3.

        When a class defines a special __init__() method,
        class instantiation automatically invokes __init__() for the newly-created class instance.
        taking apic-em IP, login, password, and version number from apicem_config.py as defaults
        To overwrite, enter IP, username, and password when initializing the instance

        Parameters
        ----------
        self: a reference to the class instance

        version (str): apic-em version
        **kwargs: an arbitrary number of keyword arguments (optional, use as needed)

        Will use the default values from apicem_config.py for host, username, password, and version
