# APIC-EM REST API Part 3 - Policy Labs

## Objective

Completion Time: 30 minutes

* Learn about the Policy based APIC-EM APIs and how to use them
* Write custom scripts using Python


## Prerequisites
* We recommend strongly you start from Part I - The Basics or Part II if you are familiar with Python
* This Lab is based on the APIC-EM release 1.3 or later.
* The url for API call in "DevNet APIC-EM always on sandbox" is https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em. This url is used for API call only, not for UI access.
* Python version 3.x is required to run sample scripts.


## Getting Started

If you are using Cisco-provided hardware at a Cisco event:

*  Lab files are already downloaded into working directory: **C:\apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\policy-labs**
*  If you cannot find downloaded sample codes you can create your working directory by typing "mkdir \apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\policy-labs\<UniqueName>".<br><br>

If you are working from your own laptop, please take the following steps to set up your system:

*  Install Python 3 and Git on your computer. See **How To Set up Your Own Computer** at the top of this page.
*  Download and install Git.  The download URL is [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*  Download the lab files from GitHub :

 ```
 cd <your working directory>
 ```

 If you are in the DevNet Zone at a Cisco Live Event open the Git Command window by either clicking on the 'Git CMD' icon on the Task Bar or in the Run bar type 'git cmd'.  In the git command window type the command below.

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes
 ```
 After the git clone completes, you will have all of the Python files that the lab steps use.

*  In order to run the Python scripts outside of a Cisco event, you need to set the **ip** variable to the IP address of the Cisco APIC-EM controller that you want the scripts to call. This variable is in the **apicem_config.py** file.<br>
For example:

 ```
 ip = 'devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'
 ```

## Executing Lab Examples

To execute the scripts, take the following steps:

1. Open a terminal and switch to the directory that holds the learning lab sample code. Typically, the `\apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\policy-labs` is your working directory.

2. Invoke Python3 as appropriate for your OS:<br>
  * Mac OS or Linux: **type: python3 programName**
  * Windows: **type: py â€“3 programName**. Or **type: python programName**


> Alternatively, you can use Python IDE - IDLE.<br> In Mac OS Terminal just type "idle3" that will bring up IDLE for Python3.<br>In Windows you can start IDLE from Start menu. See the following figure.</b><br></font>

## Step 1.  About the apicem.py Script
Same as in previous sessions, all Python sample scripts are working in a flat directory. The **apicem\_config.py** is used for configuring parameters in different environment. Those parameters are APIC-EM IP (including port number), username, password and the apic-em API version number. If you are using your own APIC-EM this is the file you need to modify. And every script needs to import **apicem.py**.<br>
But this time we want to program apicem.py in different way. We want to turn it into an object. We will create a **class** called **apicem**. We then make all functions become the methods of **apicem** object.<br>


**apicem.py script:**

        """      --apicem object initializer--

        When a class defines an special __init__() method,
        class instantiation automatically invokes __init__() for the newly-created class instance.

        Taking apic-em IP, login, password and version number from apicem_config.py as default
        To overwrite enter IP,username and password when initialize the instance

        version (str): apic-em version
        **kwargs: arbitrary number of keyword arguments (optional, use as needed)

        Will use default value from apicem_config.py for host, username, password and version

#### Next Steps

The following lab sessions create simple Python applications that interact with the Cisco APIC-EM controller by means of the NB REST API. We recommend strongly that you run the scripts in each lab session to see the live responses from APIC-EM server.

* **Lab 1: EasyQoS and related APIs - Create Policy Tag**
* Lab 2: EasyQoS and related APIs - Create Policy Tag Association
* Lab 3: EasyQoS and related APIs - Create Custom NBAR2 Application
* Lab 4: EasyQoS and related APIs - Policy Preview - New API in GA 1.3
* Lab 5: EasyQoS and related APIs - Create and Apply Policy
* Lab 6: EasyQoS and related APIs - Delete Policy,Custom NBAR2 Application,Policy Tag Association and Policy Tag
