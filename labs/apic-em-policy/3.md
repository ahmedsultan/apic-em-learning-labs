# Lab 2: EasyQoS and related APIs - Create Policy Tag Association

Policy scopes - attach policy tags to network devices (where you want EasyQOS to be enabled) - Step 2 of creating Policy

#### Policy comprises the following elements:

* <font color='red'>Policy Scope — Group of devices with the same policy tag that will be configured with the policy.</font>

* Applications — Software programs or network signaling protocols that are being used in your network. EasyQoS includes the Cisco Network Based Application Recognition, second generation (NBAR2) application library of approximately 1400 distinct applications and sub-applications. In this session we will create a custom application to be used for creating policy.

* Traffic Classes—Groups of applications that make configuring policies easier, because the groups contain applications that have similar traffic needs.

* Business-relevance—Attribute that classifies a given application according to how relevant it is to your business and operations. The attributes are business relevant, default, and business irrelevant


## Objectives
*  Learn how to use the EasyQoS related APIs to associate a policy to a network device.

These are steps of creating policy by using APIC-EM APIs


1. Create Policy Tag
   * POST /policy/tag
2. <font color='red'>Policy scopes - attach policy tags to network devices (where you want EasyQOS to be enabled)</font>
   * POST /policy/tag/association
3. Select application(s) to be used in policy, create custom one if you need to.
   * POST /application
4. Create and Apply Policy.
   * POST /policy



## Step 2 - Policy scopes - attach policy tag to network device(s) (where you want EasyQOS to be enabled)

Policy Scopes is the group of devices that will be configured with the policy so in this step we need to know which device(s) will be included. The network device id is needed to associate the device(s) and we also need to know which policy tag to use. In our case we will use the one we created in step 1. With these two minimum attributes we are ready to create a JSON object for **POST /policy/tag/association**

```
{
    "policyTag":"name of policy tag",
    "networkDevices":[{"deviceId":"network device id does here"}]
}
```

[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/)


#### Source code recap:

1. Use GET '/network-device' to build a list of IP Address/Device Name.
2. Prompt the user to select a network device from list.
3. Use GET '/policy/tag' to build a list Policy Tag.
4. Prompt the user to select a Policy Tag.
5. POST /policy/tag/association to tag device


* Source code file: lab2-1-post-policy-tag-association.py
* To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>

  **Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab2-1-post-policy-tag-association.py`<br>
  **Windows:**    `py -3 lab2-1-post-policy-tag-association.py` or `python lab2-1-post-policy-tag-association.py`

####  <font color='red'>Note: We can still create a policy without tagging device from API but eventually we need to do this step to deploy policy. To check if the association is created successfully you can run `lab2-2-get-policy-tag-association.py` script to find out.</font>

### => Proceed to next session for creating custom NBAR2 application
