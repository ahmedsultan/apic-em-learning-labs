# Lab 5: EasyQoS and related APIs - Delete Policy,Custom NBAR2 Application,Policy Tag Association and Policy Tag

You've created a custom NBAR2 application or a policy from the UI or API, and you want to delete it. Remember in previous labs we created a policy in the following order:

1. Create Policy Tag
   * POST /policy/tag  
2. Policy scopes - attach policy tags to network devices (where you want EasyQoS to be enabled)
   * POST /policy/tag/association
3. Select application(s) to be used in policy, create custom one if you need to. (Creating custom application is optional)
   * POST /application
4. Create and Apply Policy.
   * POST /policy

In this session we will learn how to undo above steps. It will be like a "Last In First Out Stack" operation. We need to delete policy first.

1. Delete Policy.
   - DELETE /policy
2. Delete custom application(s) used in policy.
   - DELETE /application (optional)
3. Delete association between tags and network devices.
   - DELETE /policy/tag/association
4. Delete Policy Tag
   - DELETE /policy/tag  

## Objectives

##### Learn how to delete policy, custom NBAR2 Application, policy tag association and policy tag. 

The delete API looks simple but because of existing APIC-EM default NBAR2 applications and how the policy is created, deleting policies or applications is not that straight forward. In this session we point out where we should pay attention when using these APIs.

### Delete policy
Using the API to create a policy creates only the policy that you've specified.  However, when the UI is used to create a policy, three policies are created.  For example, if we create the policy named 'policy123' from the UI we will get "policy123-BR", "policy123-IR" and "policy123-D". They are attributes for business relevant, business irrelevant and default. If we want to delete the policy we created we will need to execute the `DELETE /policy` request to remove each policy. Alternatively, in Lab 4 we used the API to create a policy by executing the API command `POST /policy` once and only one policy was created.

#### Source code recap:

1. Use "GET /policy" API to list all policies
2. User select a policy to delete

### Delete custom NBAR2 application (optional)

The API for deleting NBAR2 application is ```delete /application/{id}```. It looks simple.  If we forgot the name of custom application just use ```GET /application``` to list all applications and find out the name right? However, APIC-EM also includes thousands of default NBAR2 applications. Remember in the lab 4 we listed thousands of applications for you to pick one to create a policy. It appears that it's not easy to find the custom application that we created.<br>

If we can just list custom applications then life will be much easier. We actually can do that, there is filter in ```GET /application``` API. If we set parameter {"isCustom":True} in the ```GET /application``` request it should return only custom applications.

#### Source code recap:

1. Use "GET /application" API create a list
2. Use unique key/value pair to filter the custom application only list â€” we've created a function for this purpose
3. Print out the custom application list
4. User select an application from the list
5. Delete the user selected application.

### Code -- DELETE '/application'  (custom application)###

In this code we only retrieve the custom applications for user to select for deletion.

### Delete Policy Tag Association

This is to undo ```POST /policy/tag/association```. We cannot delete a policy tag that is currently associated with network device. Before deleting the policy tag we need to check the policy tag association (GET policy/tag/association).<br>
The API for deleting policy tag association is ```DELETE /policy/tag/association```.
But this DELETE request is different from the simple DELETE request. We also need to pass 2 parameters "policyTag" and "deviceId". The value of these two can be obtained from ```GET policy/tag/association```.

#### Source code recap:

1. Use "GET /policy/tag/association" API create a list
2. Print the policy tag association list
3. User select a tag association from the list
4. Retrieve the value of "policyTag" and "deviceId" based on user's selection.
5. Apply DELETE /policy/tag/association API with 2 parameters

## Session summary ##

When we execute the DELETE APIs we need to consider the dependency. For example, before deleting an application we want to make sure it is not currently used by any policy. <br>
Another example is that when delete a policy tag that is currently associated with device(s) we won't see any error but if use ```GET /task/taskId``` we will see the following error message in the response.

```
"progress": "Error while deleting policy tag myTag. Policy tag myTag is currently associated with device(s). Remove the association(s) before deleting the policy tag."
```
