# Lab 2: Network Device Related APIs

## Objectives
You can use the NB REST API to retrieve detailed information about network devices, such as IOS configuration, interface information and more. In this session, we will use network-device related APIs to create an application that let the user select a network device and view its IOS configuration. Then we will add more functionality to this application.

Our application will use the following NB REST APIs:

* GET /network-device
* GET /network-device/{networkDeviceId}/config
* GET /interface/network-device/{deviceId}

The Cisco APIC-EM assigns a unique ID to every network device. You can pass this ID to a variety of network-device related APIs to retrieve information about a specific device.<br>

**NOTE:** In order to manage network devices, the network scanning application built into the Cisco APIC-EM controller has to "discover" those physical devices on a live network. The scanning application is accessible by means of the Discovery icon in the Cisco APIC-EM GUI or by means of the `POST /discovery` REST API.<br>
The Cisco APIC-EM controller in the Always-On Sandbox is pre-populated with the results of a previous discovery, so this lab does not discuss Discovery.<br>


## Application that displays IOS configuration
In this section we will create a simple application that performs the following tasks:

* Prompts the user to select a device
* Displays the IOS configuration of the user selected device<br>


Our application will use these Cisco APIC-EM NB REST APIs:

```
GET /network-device
GET /network-device/{deviceId}/config
```

Pseudo-code:

1. Use `GET /network-device` to display a list of network devices with IP addresses
2. Accept user input of device selection
3. Use `GET /network-device/{deviceId}/config` to retrieve the IOS configuration of the specified device, then display the IOS configuration to the user.


### Step 1: Present a list of network devices with IP addresses
In order to display a list of network devices to the user, we need to retrieve network device information by issuing the `GET /network-device` request. The response body returns a list of network devices. Each block in the response provides information about a single device, including its network device name, IP, type, network-device id and more.

This network-device id provides a means of identifying a specific network device to many APIs, including the `GET /network-device/{deviceId}/config` request.

The `GET /network-device` response block provides many attributes. Our application uses the following attributes:

* "instanceUuid" or "id" is the network device id that the controller assigned to the device at discovery.
* "hostname" is the name of the network device. Note that this attribute applies to hosts or devices.
* "managementIpAddress" is the IP address of the network device.
* "type" is the type of network device, such as switch, router, access point, and so on.

### Code - `GET /network-device`, parse the response, and display the information###

In this sample code we use the `GET /network-device` API to retrieve detailed information about all network devices known to the controller. Then we parse the response for the "hostname", "managementIpAddress", "type" and "id" attributes to create a list that contains these values. We use the Python `tabulate` module to present the list as a table.

For simplicity, we place the *tabulate.py* file in the same directory as the sample code.

*  Source code file: lab2-1-get-network-device-list.py
*  To run the python file, execute one of the following:<br>

  **Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab2-1-get-network-device-list.py`<br>
  **Windows:** `py -3 lab2-1-get-network-device-list.py` or `python lab2-1-get-network-device-list.py`<br>

#### The following figure shows how we parse the response from "GET /network-device":<br>


![Figure](/posts/files/basic/network_device.png)

### Output: Device Information in Tabular Format


![Figure](/posts/files/basic/tabulate.jpg)

Now we will ask the user to select a device from the list, then our application will show the IOS configuration of the specified device.

### Step 2: Prompt the user for input and retrieve the deviceID  
The following code prompts the user to select a device from the table. Then it uses this input to retrieve the appropriate device id from previously parsed device information.

```
id = ""
device_id_idx = 4
while True:
    user_input = input('=> Select a number for the device from above to show IOS config: ')
    user_input= user_input.replace(" ","") # ignore space
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        sys.exit()
    if user_input.isdigit():
        if int(user_input) in range(1,len(device_list)+1):
            id = device_list[int(user_input)-1][device_id_idx]
            break
        else:
            print ("Oops! number is out of range, please try again or enter 'exit'")
    else:
        print ("Oops! input is not a digit, please try again or enter 'exit'")
# End of while loop

```

Now that we have the device id, we can pass it to `GET /network-device/{id}/config` to retrieve the IOS configuration of the device that the user chose.

### Step 3: Get the IOS configuration of the specified device and display it to the user
The following code passes the network device id obtained in step 2 as the {id} value in the `GET /network-device/{id}/config` request. It also creates a while loop that waits for user input and discards spaces from user input. Additionally, it provides an example of some simple error-handling code.

### Code - Pass deviceID to `GET /network-device/{id}/config`

## Adding more functionality to the application
We just learned how to retrieve the network device id of a specific device and use it to retrieve the IOS configuration of the device. This network device id can be used in other APIs, as well. For example, you can use it to get interface information from the `GET /interface/network-device/{id}` request.

#### Get interface information by device ID ####
If we want to get a list of interfaces for a given device ID, we just need make a different function call; that call is /interface/network-device/{id}.
Please refer to [APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/) for more details.
With a minor modification to the last code listing we can let the user choose whether to display IOS configuration or device interface information.<br>

**Pseudo-code:**

1. NEW: Ask the user whether to display IOS configuration or interface information; reject incorrect choices.
2. Create a network device list. This step is unchanged from the previous example.
3. Ask the user to select a network device from the list.
4. CHANGED: Call the API that reflects the user's choices in steps 1 and 3.

This output is the result of the following interactions between the application and the user:

*  User selected "1" for interfaces list
*  Application listed network devices
*  User selected 7 which is network device IP = 212.1.10.1
*  Application retrieved network device id with the IP 212.1.10.1 then applied network device id to "GET /interface/network-device/{id}" and displayed the interface list response data.


## Session summary ##

In this session, we learned:

* How to use the following network-device related APIs to retrieve network device information: `/network-device`, `/network-device/{networkDeviceId}/config` and  `/interface/network-device/{deviceId}`
* How to create a list that contains network-device information, how to display that list to the user, and how to interact with the user to accept input of values that appear in the list, while rejecting invalid values. 

The network-device id is the key to many APIC-EM APIs. There are more network-device id related APIs. With minor modifications, we can expand this application to be used for more APIs. Here are a few examples:: <br>

`GET /network-device/{id}/location` - Gets the location for the given device ID <br>
`GET /network-device/{id}` - Gets the network device for the given device ID <br>
`GET /license-info/network-device/{deviceId}` - Gets the list of licenses for network device with given device ID. <br>
`DELETE /network-device/{id}` - Removes a specific network device from inventory<br>
