## Step 2.  Command Runner

## Lab 1:  Command runner related APIs - Find out what are available IOS commands for APIC-EM API call.


The Command Runner is a new application on APIC-EM that allows you to run multiple commands (currently max of 5 at a time) on a number of devices.
You must have either administrator (ROLE_ADMIN) or policy administrator (ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN) permissions and the appropriate RBAC scope to perform this procedure.

### What commands are available?

* We can run show commands and other read-only commands on selected devices and display the output in Cisco APIC-EM, but what commands are valid for APIC-EM API to use currently ?

### Objectives
**Learn how to use the command runner related APIs to run IOS commands, find out what commands are available for API call**


#### Code -- get available commands ```GET /network-device-poller/cli/legit-reads```

[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/)

*  Source code file: lab1-1-get-legit-reads.py
*  To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>

  **Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab1-1-get-legit-reads.py`<br>
  **Windows:**  `py -3 lab1-1-get-legit-reads.py` or `python lab1-1-get-legit-reads.py`<br>
