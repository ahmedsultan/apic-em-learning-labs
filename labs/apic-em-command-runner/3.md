## Step 3.  Command Runner

## Lab 2:  Command runner related APIs - API to execute IOS commands.


In previous lab session we learned what IOS commands are available for APIC-EM API call. In this lab we will learn how to use those APIs


### Objectives
** Learn how to use the command runner API to run IOS commands.

### Use Command Runner API
* Command runner APIS are listed in APIC-EM API reference under Network Poller category. 
* There is only one API which is - POST `/network-device-poller/cli/read-request` used to executing IOS commands. This API takes two mandatory and others optional key-value pairs in JSON.

Mandatory:
```
{
      "commands" : array[string],
      "deviceUuids" : array[string]
}
```

* This API is task based, means that we won't get the result until the task is finished. The following are steps for using this API

1. POST command runner API
  * POST /network-device-poller/cli/read-request
2. Run `GET /task/{taskId}` API
  * Check the "progress" attribute in response. If task is not finished we should see         `"progress": "CLI Runner request creation"`. If the task is finished we should see ` something like  "progress": "{\"fileId\":\"e5729ba0-6e87-4257-a10a-bd7275dd20c9\"}"`.
3. Once we get the fileId then we can run `GET /file/{fileId}`. The result of `POST /network-device-poller/cli/read-request`will be in the response of  `GET /file/{fileId}`.


### Sample Application
This sample application is used to demonstrate the usage of  ```POST /network-device-poller/cli/read-request``` API. This application mimics the IOS console so user can run those IOS commands are available in command runner.

#### Steps:
1. Since we need to have the network device id and the IOS command for the POST so the first step is to collect these info.
2. Execute `POST /network-device-poller/cli/read-request` with the info collected in step 1.
3. Obtain the task id from step 2 and then check the task status with  `GET /task/{taskId}` API.
4. Once we see "fileId" the the "progress" attribute we then run `GET /file/{fileId}`
5. Extract the IOS command output from ["commandResponses"]["SUCCESS"][cmd] in response of `GET /file/{fileId}`
6. If there is nothing wrong, will prompt use to select device and enter IOS command again just like using the IOS console. 


#### Code -- Sample application ```POST /network-device-poller/cli/read-request```
