# Lab 4: Path Trace - Flow Analysis APIs

## Objectives
*  Learn how to use the `/flow-analysis` API to trace the path that packets take between two network elements (hosts or devices.)
*  Create an application from which the user can select the source and destination IP addresses.  The application will use the /flow-analysis API to process these addresses and show the path trace information.

## Step 1 - Create a list of IP addresses
To do the path trace we need to know the source and destination IP addresses. To get this information, we want to display the IP addresses for all available devices and hosts, so that the user can choose two addresses from this list. We will use what we learned in Lab 2 and Lab 3 to create this IP list.

* In lab 2, we used the `GET /network-device` API to create a list of network-device IP addresses. We  will reuse that code to create a list of network device IP addresses for this lab. Just as in lab 2, our code for this lab will extract the value of the "managementIpAddress" attribute of each block of the response body and display those IP addresses to the user.

* In lab 3,  we modified the IP list code from lab 2 to call the `GET /host` API in order to create a list of host IP addresses. Just as in lab 3, our code will extract the value of the "hostIp" attribute of each block of the response body and display those IP addresses to the user.

### Code -- Create IP list from `GET /host` and `GET /network-device`
[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/) 

The following code snippet (based on previous labs) builds the lists of the IP addresses of hosts and network devices and prints out both lists. This code does not yet provide user interaction functionality.

*  Source code file: lab4-1-get-host-network-device-iplist.py
*  To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>
	**Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab4-1-get-host-network-device-iplist.py`<br>
	**Windows:**    `py -3 lab4-1-get-host-network-device-iplist.py` or `python lab4-1-get-host-network-device-iplist.py`

**Code listing - lab4-1-get-host-network-device-iplist.py**

```
from apicem import * # apicem_config.py is the central place to change the apic-em IP, username, password ...etc

ip_list=[]
idx=0
# Create a list of host and network device
# Get host
try:
    resp= get(api="host")
    print ("Status of GET /host: ",resp.status_code)  # This is the http request status
    response_json = resp.json() # Get the json-encoded content from response
    if response_json["response"] !=[]:
        # Use enumerate to add a counter to an iterable
        for i,item in enumerate(response_json["response"]):
            ip_list.append([i+1,"host",item["hostIp"]]) # plus 1 because i start from 0
        idx=i+1 # idx will be used to tag network device 
except: 
    print ("Something wrong, cannot get host IP list")
    
# Now get network device and append to the list    
try:
    resp= get(api="network-device")
    print ("Status: of GET /network-device ",resp.status_code)  # This is the http request status
    response_json = resp.json() # Get the json-encoded content from response
    if response_json["response"] !=[]:
        # Use enumerate to add a counter to an iterable
        for i,item in enumerate(response_json["response"]):
            ip_list.append([i+idx+1,"network device",item["managementIpAddress"]])   
except:
    print ("Something wrong cannot get network-device IP list !")

print (tabulate(ip_list,headers=['number','type','ip'],tablefmt="rst"))
```

### Output
```

```

After displaying this list, we can add code that prompts the user to select source/destination IP addresses from the list. Because this user-prompt code is based on similar code that we wrote in Lab 2, we won't show it here or discuss it separately (it appears in the next step.)

With these pieces in place, we are now able to pass the user-selected IP addresses to the /flow-analysis API to generate path-trace information.

## Step 2 - Creating the path-trace application

Flow analysis is a task-based, multi-step process. Our path-trace application takes the following steps to compute the path between the user-specified IP addresses:

* A. Issue the `POST /flow-analysis` request with user-selected IP addresses
* B. Use `/task/taskId` API to monitor status of the task that the `POST /flow-analysis` request spawned
* C. When `POST /flow-analysis` is finished, retrieve pathId
* D. Issue the `GET /flow-analysis/{pathId}` request

### A. Issue the POST /flow-analysis request

The `POST /flow-analysis ` API takes 5-tuple input (two IP addresses, two ports, one
protocol):

```
PathRequest {
protocol (string, optional): Protocol,
sourcePort (string, optional): Source Port,
destPort (string, optional): Destination Port,
sourceIP (string): Source IP address,
destIP (string): Destination IP address
}
```
The sourceIP and destIP variables must have IP addresses assigned to them.  The other values are optional, but specifying the path as a 5-tuple can help to eliminate ambiguity when more than one possible path between the elements exists.

Our call to this API uses the sourceIP/destIP that the user selected from the IP list created in Step 1 of this session.

### B. Use `GET /task/taskId` to monitor `POST /flow-analysis` request status

The `POST /flow-analysis` request returns a taskId. We use this taskId in a `GET /task/taskId` request to find out when the controller has finished computing the path trace. The application needs to sit in a loop that checks status periodically until the response contains an "endTime" attribute.


### C. Retrieve pathId when `POST /flow-analysis` task is finished

When the `GET /task/taskId/` response contains an "endTime" attribute, the `POST /flow-analysis` task is finished.  We can use the value of the "progress" attribute in that same response body as the pathId value in our request that retrieves the results of the path trace.  

---

NOTE: There is no attribute named "pathId" or similar in the `GET /task/taskId/` response.
<b><font color='red'>The pathId is the value of the "progress" attribute in the `GET /task/taskId/` response.</font></b>

---


### D. Issue the `GET /flow-analysis/{pathId}` request

Once you have the pathId, you can issue the `/flow-analysis/{pathId}` request immediately. At this point, the path trace is already computed, so we should get response status 200 OK and the information we need immediately. However, it is important to remember that any request can fail for any number of reasons, so a production-grade application should always check the status that the controller returns and provide code that handles errors appropriately.

### Code -- The complete example application

The below mentioned code listing puts together all the following APIs to create the simple application that is described in the objectives section of this Learning Lab.

* `GET /host`
* `GET /network-device`
* `POST /flow-analysis`
* `GET /task/taskId`
* `GET /flow-analysis/{pathId}`

For more information, see the [APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/) 

#### Source code recap:
1. Use GET '/host' + GET '/network-device' to build a list of IP addresses.
2. Prompt the user to enter source/destination IP from list.
3. Use source/destination IP pair for `POST /flow-analysis` and get taskId.
4. Use taskId for `GET /task/taskId` to monitor the progress of `POST /flow-analysis`.
5. Get the pathId when `POST /flow-analysis` task is finished. <b><font color='red'>The pathId is the value of "progress" attribute in the `GET /task/taskId` response.</font></b>
6. Use pathId for `GET /flow-analysis/{pathId}` API to retrieve the path trace information.

**Output walkthrough**

1. Display a list of host and network device IPs.
2. User selected sourceIP = 211.2.2.1, destIP = 212.1.10.20.
3. We then passed the selected sourceIP = 211.2.2.1, destIP = 212.1.10.20 to POST /flow-analysis and got "taskId" =  "0c438197-44a1-4168-b261-ec9a9eac1703".
4. The first response from "GET /task/813d6c36-f01e-4395-bfa1-6c0f099cd83a" doesn't have endTime so sleep 1 second and then retry.
5. The next response has "endTime": 1447880215604, indicating that the task is finished. We can now use the value of the "progress" attribute ("3d06717f-c55e-4f19-af3b-675b900653ba") as the pathId value in our call to the "GET /flow-analysis/{pathId}" API.
6. The pathId is then passed to API "GET /flow-analysis/{pathId}"
7. From the "networkElementsInfo" attribute in the response of "GET /flow-analysis/{pathId}" we can see the routing path started from host 211.2.2.1 then reached CAMPUS-Dist1 with IP=55.1.1.100.  The next hop was CAMPUS-Access1 with IP=212.1.10.1, and finally we  arrive at the host with IP=212.1.10.20, which is the destination.

## Session Summary ##
We learned how to use the `POST /flow-analysis` API to trace a path between two IP addresses. We learned that the "POST /flow-analysis" API is a task-based API that requires use of the `GET /task/{taskId}` API to check the status of the request.  We used `GET /flow-analysis/{pathId}` to get the final result of the `POST /flow-analysis` request. These steps match the following main sections of this lab:

* A. POST /flow-analysis
* B. Use GET /task/{taskId} API to monitor POST /flow-analysis request status
* C. When POST /flow-analysis is finished retrieve the pathId. The pathId is the value of "progress" attribute in the response data of "GET /task/{taskId}" API.
* D. Apply GET /flow-analysis/{pathId} API

You can use similar steps to monitor the progress of any request that returns a task ID. In particular, this pattern is particularly useful for requests that return a 202 (accepted) response:

1.  Send request and get a taskId in the response body.
2.  Use `GET /task/{taskId}` API to monitor request status
3.  When task is finished then retrieve attributes needed for your application to do further processing.

Although this example is text-based for the sake of simplicity, what we learned in this session can be used in an application that shows path trace results graphically, like the following example. This screen is from the "Path Trace" application in the Cisco APIC-EM GUI, which uses these very same APIs to do its work.

## <font color='red'> New for GA1.2 </font>

This lab session should continue to work for the GA1 release but the latest release introduced a new API `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}`. A new attribute "flowAnalysisId" is also added in the response of `POST /flow-analysis/`. The value of this attribute is used for `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}`.<br>
There is a "status" attribute in the response of `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}`. We can use it to check if the `POST /flow-analysis/` task is finished in stead of checking the completion of task.

* status : "COMPLETED". A path trace is created
* status : "INPROGRESS". The task is not finished yet.
* status : "FAILED".For various reasons that APIC-EM was unable to find full path.

Here is the sample code with non-blocking polling method.

* Source code file: lab4-3-get-path-trace-with-flowAnalysisId.py
* To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>
	**Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab4-3-get-path-trace-with-flowAnalysisId.py`<br>
	**Windows:**    `py -3 lab4-3-get-path-trace-with-flowAnalysisId.py` or `python lab4-3-get-path-trace-with-flowAnalysisId.py`
