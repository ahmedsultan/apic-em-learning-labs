# Lab 1: Generate and use a new service ticket

## Objective

* What is RBAC and why do you need a service ticket 
* How to get a service ticket using POST /ticket REST API call.
* How to use the service ticket for subsequent requests.

## What is RBAC and why do you need a service ticket? 

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism on the Cisco APIC-EM assigns a security role to every user account. That role determines which Cisco APIC-EM resources and operations are available to the account.

The GA release of Cisco APIC-EM defines the following roles and privileges:

* **Administrator (ROLE_ADMIN)** provides the user with full administrative privileges to all Cisco APIC-EM resources, including the ability to add or remove users and accounts.
* **Policy Administrator (ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN)** allows the user to create and manage policies. 
* **Observer (ROLE_OBSERVER)** provides the user with primarily read-only privileges to the Cisco APIC-EM. 
* **Installer (ROLE_INSTALLER)** enables the user to use the Cisco Plug and Play Mobile App to remotely access the APIC-EM controller in order to deploy devices and view device status. An installer cannot directly access the Cisco APIC-EM GUI.

A security token known as a service ticket encapsulates user identity and role information as a single value. 

RBAC-governed APIs use the service ticket to make access-control decisions. Therefore, to start, you send the Cisco APIC-EM a `POST /ticket` request with your username and password. If the APIC-EM controller authenticates your request, it returns a service ticket that encapsulates the role associated with the authenticated user account. 

After you get the service ticket, you include it in all of the subsequent calls you send to the controller. When the controller receives those calls, it checks the service ticket before performing the action requested by the call.

## Generate a service ticket

So, to get a service ticket:

1. Locate the `lab1-1-post-ticket.py` script among the files you synced earlier. For example: `apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\basic-labs\lab1-1-post-ticket.py`
2. If you’re using an alternate APIC-EM instead of the default one edit the `username` and `password` parameter values.
3. Use a python command to run the script. For example:
    * On Linux or Mac OS: `python3 lab1-1-post-ticket.py`
    * On Windows: `py -3 lab1-1-post-ticket.py or python lab1-1-post-ticket.py`

#### Code listing: `lab1-1-post-ticket.py`

Here’s the script code, with comments:

# APIC-EM IP, modify these parameters if you are using your own APIC-EM
apicem_ip = "devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em"

version = "v1"

# JSONhttps://sandboxapic.cisco.com/ input
r_json = {
    "username": username,

}

# POST ticket API URL
post_url = "https://"+apicem_ip+"/api/"+version+"/ticket"

# All APIC-EM REST API request and response content type is JSON.
headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}

# Make request and get response - "resp" is the response of this request
resp = requests.post(post_url, json.dumps(r_json), headers=headers,verify=False)
print ("Request Status: ",resp.status_code)

# Get the json-encoded content from response
response_json = resp.json()
print ("\nRaw response from POST ticket request:\n",resp.text)
# Not that easy to read the raw response, so try the formatted print out

# Pretty print the raw response
print ("\nPretty print response:\n",json.dumps(response_json,indent=4))

</code></pre>

</details>


Here’s the script output:

```json
('Request Status: ', 200)
('\nRaw response from POST ticket request:\n', u'{"response":{"serviceTicket":"ST-16302-cKDpKVcv0fek6nx5YeaT-cas","idleTimeout":1800,"sessionTimeout":21600},"version":"1.0"}')
('\nPretty print response:\n', '{\n    "version": "1.0", \n    "response": {\n        "idleTimeout": 1800, \n        "sessionTimeout": 21600, \n        "serviceTicket": "ST-16302-cKDpKVcv0fek6nx5YeaT-cas"\n    }\n}')
```

The service ticket we need is the value of `serviceTicket` attribute. For example:
`"serviceTicket": "ST-16302-cKDpKVcv0fek6nx5YeaT-cas"`

To extract the service ticket value programmatically, use the following code to parse that response:

```
response_json = r.json() 
print ("ticket: ",response_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]) 
```

This code produces output similar to this:

`ticket:  ST-16302-cKDpKVcv0fek6nx5YeaT-cas`

## Put the service ticket and other reusable items in a file 

Many of our scripts will reuse the service ticket and other values (e.g., `host url`, `username`, and `password`). They will also import the same modules, such as `requests` and `json`. Therefore, it makes sense to configure/define/import these items one place---the `apicem.py` file. 

Since our scripts will need to generate new service tickets frequently, we’ll also add a `Thisget_X_auth_token()` function to the `apicem.py` file.

To access the items `apicem.py` file, we start every script in this lab with the following import statement:

```python
from apicem import *
```
 
*This import statement lets us access all of the resources in apicem.py*

### Using the service ticket

Generally, every API call you send to Cisco APIC-EM REST must provide a service ticket. It doesn't matter whether the request is a `POST`, `GET`, `PUT` or `DELETE`. To incorporate a service ticket in your request, add an `X-Auth-Token` header that provides the service ticket as its value:

```json
{"X-Auth-Token": "service_ticket_value" } 
```

Then assign the service ticket to that `service_ticket_value`. You don't have to get a new service ticket every time when make a request but you do need to provide a valid and unexpired service ticket in the header. In here we get new ticket every time for the simplicity but later, we will manage service ticket in different way.

Here, let's use a `GET /user` request to demonstrate how to use a service ticket. This request returns a list of APIC-EM users. The content of the list it returns is governed by the role of the caller. If the caller is an admin user, it returns a list of all users. If the caller has the observer role, it returns only the caller's own user information.

The `GET /user` request does not require any arguments. Add an `X-Auth-Token` header to your `GET /user` request. The value of `X-Auth-Token` is the service ticket that your previous call to `POST /ticket` returned.

![Figure](/posts/files/apic-em-basic/header.jpg)

Code: GET /user request

Service ticket is the return value of `get_X_auth_token()` function in `apicem.py`. In `get()` function we call get_X_auth_token() so in the following script we won't see any statement for obtaining the token. In fact we won't see it at all in following labs because it's embedded in all GET,POST,PUT and DELETE functions in apicem.py.


*  Source code file: `lab1-2-get-user.py`
*  To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>
    * **Linux** or **Mac OS: Type:**  `python3 lab1-2-get-user.py`<br>
    * **Windows: Type:** `py -3 lab1-2-get-user.py` or `python lab1-2-get-user.py`<br>

from apicem import *


# Controller ip, username and password are defined in apicem_config.py
# The get() function is defined in apicem.py
# Get token function is called in get() function
try:
    resp= get(api="user")

    print (json.dumps(response_json,indent=4),'\n') # Convert "response_json" object to a JSON formatted string and print it out
except:
    print ("Something wrong with GET /user request")
    sys.exit()

for item in response_json["response"]:
    for item1 in item["authorization"]:
        print ("User \'%s\', role is the %s."%(item["username"],(item1["role"])[5:]))

# [5:] = skip first 5 characters of string item1["role"]

</code></pre>
</details>


#### Output

The response body from the controller shows that the `devnetuser` username has the `ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN` security role.

```
Executing GET 'https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em/api/v1/user'

Get 'user' Status:  200

{
    "response": [
        {
            "authorization": [
                {
                    "role": "ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN",
                    "scope": "ALL"
                }
            ],
            "username": "devnetuser",
            "authSource": "internal"
        }
    ],
    "version": "1.0"
}

User 'devnetuser', role is the POLICY_ADMIN.
```
 
The following picture shows which part of code produces what output. As you can see, there are two for loops in the code. The outer loop iterates the content within "response":[....]. The inner loop iterates the content within "authorization":[.....].

## Session Summary
In this session we learned:

* How to create a service ticket by calling `POST /ticket`.
* How to use the service ticket in a subsequent request by placing `{"X-Auth-Token": ticket}` in a header.
* How to put frequently used code in one file, `apicem.py`. 
* How to `import apicem` and reuse its capabilities.

## Next Steps
