# Lab 1: Generate a new service ticket and get users

The **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** mechanism on the Cisco APIC-EM assigns exactly one security role to every user account. The role associated with the account determines the set of resources and operations that are available to the account. The GA release of Cisco APIC-EM defines the following roles and privileges.

* Administrator (ROLE_ADMIN) — Provides full administrative privileges to all Cisco APIC-EM resources, including the ability to add or remove users and accounts.<br>
* Policy Administrator (ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN) — Allows you to create and manage policies. <br>
* Observer (ROLE_OBSERVER) — Provides primarily read-only privileges to the Cisco APIC-EM. <br>
* Installer (ROLE_INSTALLER) — Allows an installer to use the Cisco Plug and Play Mobile App to remotely access the APIC-EM controller to deploy devices and view their status. An installer cannot directly access the Cisco APIC-EM GUI.

A security token known as a **service ticket** encapsulates user identity and role information as a single value that RBAC-governed APIs use to make access-control decisions.<font color='red'><b> You must create and provide a service ticket!</b></font>

Virtually all NB REST requests to the Cisco APIC-EM must supply a service ticket. The noteworthy exception to this rule is the request that actually generates a service ticket. The `POST /ticket` request bases its access-control decision on the username and password supplied as its arguments; successful authentication generates a service ticket that encapsulates the role associated with the authenticated user account.


## Objectives

In Lab 1 we will learn:

* How to use the `POST /ticket` REST API to generate a service ticket.
* How to use the service ticket for subsequent requests.

## Generating a service ticket

To get a new service ticket we need to use `POST /ticket` API.
This POST request needs to provide APIC-EM username and password as input in JSON format. The username and password is the same as the one used to login to APIC-EM Controller Graphic User Interface (GUI).

**Example of JSON input for `POST /ticket`:**

```
{
	"username": "admin",
	"password": "mypassword"
}
```

#### Code - POST '/ticket' :
[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/)

* Provide username and password in the JSON body of the POST /ticket request.
* Provide a Content-Type header that specifies application/json as the content type.
* Source code file: lab1-1-post-ticket.py
* To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>
	**Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab1-1-post-ticket.py`<br>
	**Windows:**    `py -3 lab1-1-post-ticket.py` or `python `lab1-1-post-ticket.py`

import requests   # We use Python "requests" module to do HTTP GET query
import json       # Import JSON encoder and decode module
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings() # Disable warnings

# APIC-EM IP
apicem_ip = "devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em"

username = "devnetuser"
password = "Cisco123!"
version = "v1"

# JSON input
r_json = {
    "username": username,
    "password": password
}

# API URL
post_url = "https://"+apicem_ip+"/api/"+version+"/ticket"

# All APIC-EM REST API request and response content type is JSON.
headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}

# Make request and get response - "resp" is the response of this request
resp = requests.post(post_url, json.dumps(r_json), headers=headers,verify=False)
print ("Request Status: ",resp.status_code)

# Get the json-encoded content from response
response_json = resp.json() 
print ("Response:",json.dumps(response_json,indent=4))
```

### Output:
```
Request Status:  200
Response: {
    "version": "1.0",
    "response": {
        "serviceTicket": "ST-781-PRmDXdfVcN3a7HWnZ23m-cas",
        "sessionTimeout": 21600,
        "idleTimeout": 1800
    }
}ion": "1.0"
}
```

The service ticket we need is the value of "serviceTicket" attribute. We need to parse the response to extract the service ticket
For example, the following code:

```python
response_json = r.json()
print ("ticket: ",response_json["response"]["serviceTicket"])
```
produces output like the following:

```
ticket:  ST-781-PRmDXdfVcN3a7HWnZ23m-cas
```

"ST-781-PRmDXdfVcN3a7HWnZ23m-cas" is the service ticket.

## The essentials of the APIC-EM API request
As you can see in the example code above, every request uses many of the same values, such as the IP address of the APIC-EM, a username, a password and a service ticket. Creating variables to hold these values modularizes your code and makes it easier to maintain.

You also see that we need to import many of the same modules that support REST API requests, such as the "requests" and "json" modules. Putting all of these imports in one central place allows us to configure/define/import them just once. That "central place" is  the apicem.py file.

Since we also need to generate service tickets frequently, let's create a function that generates a service ticket so that we can reuse that code easily, as well. This get_X_auth_token() function also goes in the apicem.py file.

To make this handy stuff available, every lab file that calls the Cisco APIC-EM from Python will need to import the apicem.py file. To do so, add the following line to the beginning of every Python program file that you create in this lab:

<pre>from apicem.py import *</pre>

<b><font color='red'> If you are NOT at a Cisco event, you will need modify configuration file - apicem\_config.py.</b><br></font>

## Using the service ticket

Generally, every Cisco APIC-EM REST request needs to provide a service ticket - it doesn't matter whether the request is a POST, GET, PUT or DELETE. To incorporate a service ticket in your request, add an `X-Auth-Token` header that provides the service ticket as its value:

	 {"X-Auth-Token": "*service_ticket_value*" }

Let's use the `GET /user` request to demonstrate how to use a service ticket. This request returns a list of APIC-EM users. The content of the list it returns is governed by the role of the caller. If the caller is an admin user, it returns a list of all users. If the caller has the observer role, it returns only the caller's own user information.

The `GET /user` request requires no arguments, but it does require a service ticket. To provide this ticket, add an `X-Auth-Token` header to your `GET /user` request. The value of the `X-Auth-Token` header is the service ticket that a previous call to `POST /ticket` returned.

Recall that in the previous section of this lab, that the source code file apic_config.py contains a `get_X_auth_token()` function that issues the `POST /ticket` request from Python. In this section, the value of the `X-Auth-Token` placed into the header in our `GET /user` request is the value that `get_X_auth_token()` returns.


#### Code: `GET /user` request
[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/)

Service ticket is the return value of "get\_X\_auth\_token" function(in apicem.py).
*  Source code file: lab1-2-get-user.py
*  To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>
	**Linux** or **Mac OS: Type:**  `python3 lab1-2-get-user.py`<br>
  **Windows: Type:** `py -3 lab1-2-get-user.py` or `python lab1-2-get-user.py`

**Code listing - `lab1-2-get-user.py`:**

```
"""
Get all APIC-EM users
"""
from apicem import *

# get() function is defined in apicem.py
# controller ip, username and password are defined in apicem_config.py
try:
    resp= get(api="user")
    response_json = resp.json() # Get the json-encoded content from response
    print ("Status: ",resp.status_code) # This is the http request status
    print (json.dumps(response_json,indent=4),'\n') # Convert "response_json" object to a JSON formatted string and print it out
except:
    print ("Something wrong with GET /user request")
    sys.exit()
    
# Parsing raw response to list all users and their role
for item in response_json["response"]:
    for item1 in item["authorization"]:
        print ("User \'%s\', role is the %s."%(item["username"],(item1["role"])[5:]))
```

#### Output:
The response body from the controller shows that the `devnetuser` username has the `ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN` security role.

```
Executing GET 'https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em/api/v1/user'

                    "role": "ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN",
                    "scope": "ALL"
                }

        }

## Session Summary
In this session we learned:

* How to create a service ticket. (Use the `POST /ticket` API.)
* How to use the service ticket in a subsequent request.  (Provide the `{"X-Auth-Token": ticket}` header.)
* How to put frequently used code in one file (apicem.py) so you can import and reuse it easily.
