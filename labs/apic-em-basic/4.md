# Lab 3: Host and Task Service APIs

## Objectives
In this session, we will learn:

* What is a **host** ? What can we do with the **host** API?
* Why do we need **task service** APIs, such as the `GET /task/{taskId}`, `GET /task/{offset}/{limit}` and `GET /task/{taskId}/tree` requests?

Like the `network-device` API we explored in the previous session, the `host` API provides a way to get information about network elements; however, the `host` API interacts with `hosts`, rather than with the devices that the `network-device` API manages. Both APIs are commonly used by many applications.

All northbound REST requests to the Cisco APIC-EM complete asynchronously. Often, the time to complete the original request is insignificant. However, tasks that take a bit longer to complete may return a 202 (Accepted) response to indicate that the original request was accepted but the task that it spawned may not yet be complete. When you get a 202 response, it includes a taskID that you can pass to the `/task` API to get information on the status of the asynchronous task that the original API call spawned.  

In this session, we'll use the host API to get some host information, and we'll use the task API to retrieve information about the asynchronous task spawned by a REST request that returned a 202 status.

## What does "host" mean to Cisco APIC-EM ?
The network-scanning application classifies each network element that it discovers as a `network-device` or as a `host`. A **network-device** is part of the network traffic-management infrastructure, while a **host** is not part of the traffic-management infrastructure. For example, switches, routers, access points and wireless LAN controllers are network devices. A laptop connected to a switch is a host, as is an IP phone connected to a wireless LAN controller.
A `host` can be discovered via **CDP/LLDP/IP** Device Tracking or **SNMP** Traps (only for wireless hosts).

The following picture shows the relation between a host and a network device.

## What can we do with the host API ?

Just as the `/network-device` API can be used to retrieve device information, the `/host` API can be used to get detailed information about hosts in Inventory. For example, you can use the host API to get the name of a host, the ID of the VLAN that the host uses, the IP address of the host, the MAC address of the host, the IP address of the network device to which host is connected, and more.

### How to create a list of host IP addresses using the "GET /host" API
The `GET /host` response body contains the host name, type, IP and other information of each host. We can build a list of host IP addresses by parsing the response data and extracting the value of the "hostIp" attribute of each device that is represented in the response body. This is similar to what we did in Lab 2 to parse the response from the `GET /network-device` request.

[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/) 

### Code -- GET '/host' ###

This code snippet gets all hosts from the controller, then parses the raw response to create a list of all host IP addresses. The raw response contains a block for each host; in each of these blocks, the "hostIp" attribute holds the IP address of a particular host.

*  Source code file: lab3-1-get-host.py
*  To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>
				**Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab3-1-get-host.py`<br>
				**Windows:** `py -3 lab3-1-get-host.py` or `python lab3-1-get-host.py`

**Code listing - lab3-1-get-host.py**

```python
from apicem import * # apicem_config.py is the central place to change the apic-em IP, username, password ...etc

try:
    resp = get(api="host")
    response_json = resp.json() # Get the json-encoded content from response
    print ("Status: ",resp.status_code)  # This is the http request status
    print (json.dumps(response_json,indent=4)) # Convert "response_json" object to a JSON formatted string and print it out    
except:
    print ("Something wrong with GET /host request!")
    
# Now create a list of host summary

host_list=[]
for item in response_json["response"]:
    host_list.append([item["hostIp"],item["hostType"],item["connectedNetworkDeviceIpAddress"]])

# We use tabulate module here to print a nice table format. You should use "pip" tool to install in your local machine
# For the simplicity we just copy the source code in working directory, didn't install it
print (tabulate(host_list,headers=['host IP','type','connected to network device'],tablefmt="rst"))
```

## What is the "GET /task/{taskId}" API? Why do we need it?
[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/) 

As noted earlier, the APIC-EM cannot return the result of certain requests immediately. These requests return a status 202 (accepted) that provides a <b>task id</b> in the response body. The task id is like an "order number" that you can use to inquire about the status of the task your original request spawned.  

You need to check the status of your task explicitly because the NB REST API doesn't provide an event model or a callback mechanism that would provide another means of notifying you of the status of an asynchronous task. Instead, you need to use this "order number" (task id) to ask APIC-EM whether your order is ready (the task is complete).

---

  <b>NOTE:</b> There is no guarantee that a task will have completed before you issue your first request for its status; you might have to wait an appropriate period of time and then check again.

---

Let's take a look at exactly how we would issue the `GET /api/v1/task/taskId` request to see whether a particular task is finished.<br>

#### Example 1: GET /api/v1/task/a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d

Here is an example of a 202 (accepted) response that provides a taskId:

```
Status:  202
Response:
 {
    "response": {
        "url": "/api/v1/task/a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d",
        "taskId": "a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d"
    },
    "version": "1.0"
}
```

The taskId <b>"a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d"</b> above is our "order number". To ask the controller about the status of this "order", issue the `GET /api/v1/task/taskId` request, substituting the task ID value of a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d for the taskId portion of this request.

The first time that we issue the GET /api/v1/task/a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d request, we might get a response like the following:

```

Response:
 {
    "response": {
        "isError": false,
        "startTime": 1447198488595,
        "progress": "CREATE",
        "id": "a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d",
        "version": 1447198488595,
        "rootId": "a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d",
        "serviceType": "Policy Analysis Service"
    },
    "version": "1.0"
}
```
In this example, we can see that the response provides  a `startTime`, which means that task `a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d` has started. But we don't see the `endTime` attribute, which is one indication that this task isn't finished yet.


#### Example 2: GET /api/v1/task/a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d
If we wait a bit before issuing the `GET /api/v1/task/a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d` request again, we might get a response like the following:

```
{
    "response": {
        "isError": false,
        "endTime": 1447198490018,
        "startTime": 1447198488595,
        "progress": "5a52c63a-481c-49fb-ab11-b04484c54d6b",
        "id": "a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d",
        "version": 1447198488595,
        "rootId": "a171b29b-a2cb-45ec-b70c-98b2fa12699d",
        "serviceType": "Policy Analysis Service"
    },
    "version": "1.0"
}
```
This time, the response body has an `endTime` attribute, which indicates that this task is finished. However... presence of `endTime` alone doesn't indicate whether the task completed *successfully* or just ended unsuccessfully.

Notice also that the value of the "progress"  attribute has changed from "CREATE" to a hex string.

The "isError" attribute provides definitive information about success or failure of the completed task. If the value of isError is "true" it means that the task did not complete successfully.

In an upcoming session of this Learning Lab, you will write code that uses the `/task` API to wait for an asynchronous task to complete before retrieving the result that the task generated.



## Session summary ##
* The `host` API works similarly to the `network-device` API. You can use the host API to find out how many hosts are in Inventory, how each host connects to the network, and much more.  <br>
* The `task` API provides a way to retrieve information about the status of an asynchronous task that a REST request spawned, such as whether it completed successfully.<br>

In the next lab session, we will apply what we learned in this session and previous sessions, putting it all together to work with a new API, the `/flow-analysis` API.
