# Step 2: Understand the Network Host APIs

## Objectives
* Understand what a `host` is.
* Learn what you can do with the `host` API.

Like the `network-device` API you explored in the previous session, the `host` API provides a way to get information about network elements. The `host` API, however, interacts with `hosts`, rather than with the devices that the `network-device` API manages. Many applications use both of these APIs.

In this session, you use the host API to get some host information.

## What does `host` mean to Cisco APIC-EM?
The network-scanning application classifies each network element that it discovers as a `network-device` or as a `host`. A `network-device` is part of the network traffic-management infrastructure, but a `host` is not part of the traffic-management infrastructure. For example, switches, routers, access points, and wireless LAN controllers are network devices. A laptop connected to a switch is a host, as is an IP phone connected to a wireless LAN controller.
A `host` can be discovered using `CDP/LLDP/IP` device tracking or `SNMP` traps (for wireless hosts only).

The following picture shows the relationship between a host and a network device.

## What can you do with the host API?

Now use `/host` to get detailed information about hosts in the Inventory. For example, you can use the host API to get the name of a host, the ID of the VLAN that the host uses, the IP address of the host, the MAC address of the host, the IP address of the network device to which host is connected, and more.

## How to create a list of host IP addresses using the `GET /host` API
The `GET /host` response body contains the host name, type, IP address, and other information of each host. You can build a list of host IP addresses by parsing the response data and extracting the value of the `hostIp` attribute of each device that is represented in the response body. This is similar to what you did in Part I to parse the response from the `GET /network-device` request.


## Code -- GET '/host'

This code snippet gets all hosts from the controller, then parses the raw response to create a list of all host IP addresses. The raw response contains a block for each host. In each of these blocks, the `hostIp` attribute holds the IP address of a particular host.

## Session summary

* The `host` API works similarly to the `network-device` API. You can use the host API to find out how many hosts are in Inventory, how each host connects to the network, and much more.  <br>
* In the next lab session, you apply what you learned in this session, putting it all together to work with a new API, the `/flow-analysis` API.

## Next step

Proceed to Step 2: Use Path Trace.
