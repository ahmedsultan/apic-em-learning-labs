# Step 3: Use Path Trace

## Objectives
*  Learn how to use the `/flow-analysis` API to trace the path that packets take between two network elements (hosts or devices.)
*  Create an application from which the user can select the source and destination IP addresses.  The application will use the `/flow-analysis` API to process these addresses and show the path trace information.

## Task 1 - Create a list of IP addresses (host and network devices)
To perform the path trace, you need the source and destination IP addresses. To get this information, you display the IP addresses for all available devices and hosts, so that the user can choose two addresses from this list. You will use what you learned in previous sessions to create this IP list.

* In Part I, you used the `GET /network-device` API to create a list of network device IP addresses. Use the same API to create a list of network device IP addresses for this lab. Your code for this lab will extract the value of the `managementIpAddress` attribute of each block of the response body and display those IP addresses to the user.

* From the `GET /host` API , you can extract the value of the `hostIp` attribute from each block of the response body and display those IP addresses to the user.

### Code -- Create IP list from `GET /host` and `GET /network-device`


The following code snippet builds the lists of IP addresses of hosts and network devices and prints out both lists. This code does not yet provide user interaction functionality.

After displaying this list, you can add code that prompts the user to select source/destination IP addresses from the list. Because the user-prompt code is based on code that is similar to what you wrote in Part I, it isn't covered again.

With these pieces in place, you are now able to pass the user-selected IP addresses to the `/flow-analysis` API to generate path-trace information.

## Task 2 - Create the path-trace application

Flow analysis is a task-based, multi-step process. Your path-trace application takes the following steps to compute the path between the user-specified IP addresses:

* A. Issues the `POST /flow-analysis` request with user-selected IP addresses
* B. Uses the `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` API to monitor status of the `POST /flow-analysis`.
* C. When the `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` status attribute is "COMPLETED" then the response from `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` contains the result you want.


### A. Issue the POST /flow-analysis request

The `POST /flow-analysis ` API takes five-tuple input (two IP addresses, two ports, one protocol):

```
PathRequest {
protocol (string, optional): Protocol,
sourcePort (string, optional): Source Port,
destPort (string, optional): Destination Port,
sourceIP (string): Source IP address,
destIP (string): Destination IP address
}
```
The `sourceIP` and `destIP` variables must have IP addresses assigned to them.  There are other optional values, but specifying the path as a five-tuple can help to eliminate ambiguity when more than one possible path between the elements exists.

Your call to this API uses the `sourceIP/destIP` that the user selected from the IP list created in Step 1 of this session.

### B. Use `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` to monitor `POST /flow-analysis` request status

The `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` request returns a status of `POST /flow-analysis`.

* status : `COMPLETED`. A path trace is created.
* status : `INPROGRESS`. The task is not finished yet.
* status : `FAILED`. For some reason, APIC-EM was unable to find the full path.


### C. Wait for the status to be `COMPLETED`

When the `status` attribute in the response from `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` is `COMPLETED`, then that response contains all of the information you need for the path trace.


### Code -- The complete example application

The following code listing puts together the following APIs to create the simple application that is described in the objectives section of this Learning Lab.

* `GET /host`
* `GET /network-device`
* `POST /flow-analysis`
* `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}`

For more information, see [APIC-EM API Reference Docs](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em-rest-api/)

### Source code recap
1. Use `GET /host` and `GET /network-device` to build a list of IP addresses.
2. Prompt the user to enter the source/destination IP from the list.
3. Use the source/destination IP pair for `POST /flow-analysis`.
4. Use `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` to monitor the progress of `POST /flow-analysis`.
5. Retrieve the path trace information when the status is `COMPLETED`. If the status is `FAIL` or the script times out, then the full path was not found.

* Source code file: `lab2-2-get-path-trace-with-flowAnalysisId.py`

	*  On Linux or macOS: `python3 lab2-2-get-path-trace-with-flowAnalysisId.py`

### Output walkthrough

1. A list of host and network device IP addresses are displayed using `GET /host` and `GET /network-device`.
2. `sourceIP = 10.2.1.22` and `destIP = 10.1.12.20` are selected by the user.
3. `sourceIP = 10.2.1.22` and  `destIP = 10.1.12.20` are then passed to `POST /flow-analysis` returning `flowAnalysisId` =  `d8a9047f-bd87-4305-ac2b-e45e0d903dec`.
4. `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` is used to monitor the progress of `POST /flow-analysis`.
5. From the `request["status"]` attribute in the response from `GET /flow-analysis/flowAnalysisId` you can monitor the `POST /flow-analysis` request status.
6. When the `POST /flow-analysis` task completes, you can then see from the "networkElementsInfo" attribute in the response from `GET /flow-analysis/flowAnalysisId` that the routing path started from host 10.2.1.22, reached the Branch-Access1 switch with IP=10.2.1.17, and finally arrived at the host with IP=10.1.12.20, which is the destination.

## Session summary

You learned how to use the `POST /flow-analysis` API to trace a path between two IP addresses. You learned that the `POST /flow-analysis` API is a task-based API that requires the use of the `GET  /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` API to check the status of the request.  You used `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` to get the final result of the `POST /flow-analysis` request. These steps match the following main sections of this lab:

* A. Use `POST /flow-analysis`.
* B. Use the `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` API to monitor the `POST /flow-analysis` request status.
* C. You should get either `COMPLETED` or `FAIL` as the status from `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` when the task of POST /flow-analysis is finished. If it cannot get the result in 20 seconds, the script will time out.

Although this example is text-based for the sake of simplicity, what you learned in this session can be used in an application that shows path trace results graphically, like the following example. This screen is from the `Path Trace` application in the Cisco APIC-EM GUI, which uses these very same APIs to do its work.

### <font color='red'>Note: Because you are using database-only Sandbox, not all source/destination pairs are able to retrieve the trace path. </font>

### Congratulations!  You've completed Part II of APIC-EM REST API Learning Labs
