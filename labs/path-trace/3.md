# Lab 2: Path Trace - Flow Analysis APIs

## Objectives
*  Learn how to use the `/flow-analysis` API to trace the path that packets take between two network elements (hosts or devices.)
*  Create an application from which the user can select the source and destination IP addresses.  The application will use the /flow-analysis API to process these addresses and show the path trace information.

## Step 1 - Create a list of IP addresses (host+network device)
To do the path trace we need to know the source and destination IP addresses. To get this information, we want to display the IP addresses for all available devices and hosts, so that the user can choose two addresses from this list. We will use what we learned in previous sessions to create this IP list.

* In part I, we used the `GET /network-device` API to create a list of network-device IP addresses. We  will use the same API to create a list of network device IP addresses for this lab. Our code for this lab will extract the value of the "managementIpAddress" attribute of each block of the response body and display those IP addresses to the user.

* From  `GET /host` API , we can extract the value of the "hostIp" attribute of each block of the response body and display those IP addresses to the user.

### Code -- Create IP list from `GET /host` and `GET /network-device`
[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/) 

The following code snippet builds the lists of the IP addresses of hosts and network devices and prints out both lists. This code does not yet provide user interaction functionality.

*  Source code file: lab2-1-get-host-network-device-iplist.py
*  To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>

After displaying this list, we can add code that prompts the user to select source/destination IP addresses from the list. Because this user-prompt code is based on similar code that we wrote in Lab 2, we won't show it here or discuss it separately.<br>

With these pieces in place, we are now able to pass the user-selected IP addresses to the /flow-analysis API to generate path-trace information.

## Step 2 - Creating the path-trace application

Flow analysis is a task-based, multi-step process. Our path-trace application takes the following steps to compute the path between the user-specified IP addresses:

* A. Issue the `POST /flow-analysis` request with user-selected IP addresses
* B. Use `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` API to monitor status of the `POST /flow-analysis`.
* C. When `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` status attribute is "COMPLETED" then the response of `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` has the result we want.


### A. Issue the POST /flow-analysis request

The `POST /flow-analysis ` API takes 5-tuple input (two IP addresses, two ports, one protocol):

```
PathRequest {
protocol (string, optional): Protocol,
sourcePort (string, optional): Source Port,
destPort (string, optional): Destination Port,
sourceIP (string): Source IP address,
destIP (string): Destination IP address
}
```
The sourceIP and destIP variables must have IP addresses assigned to them.  There are other optional values , but specifying the path as a 5-tuple can help to eliminate ambiguity when more than one possible path between the elements exists.

Our call to this API uses the sourceIP/destIP that the user selected from the IP list created in Step 1 of this session.

### B. Use `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` to monitor `POST /flow-analysis` request status

The `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` request returns a status of `POST /flow-analysis`. 

* status : "COMPLETED". A path trace is created
* status : "INPROGRESS". The task is not finished yet.<br>
* status : "FAILED".For various reasons that APIC-EM was unable to find full path.


### C. Waiting for the status is "COMPLETED"

When we see the "status" attribute in the response of  `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` is "COMPLETED" then that response contains all the information we need for the path trace.


### Code -- The complete example application

The below mentioned code listing puts together all the following APIs to create the simple application that is described in the objectives section of this Learning Lab.

* `GET /host`
* `GET /network-device`
* `POST /flow-analysis`
* `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}`

For more information, see the [APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/) 

#### Source code recap:
1. Use GET '/host' + GET '/network-device' to build a list of IP addresses.
2. Prompt the user to enter source/destination IP from list.
3. Use source/destination IP pair for `POST /flow-analysis`.
4. Use GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId} to monitor the progress of `POST /flow-analysis`.
5. Retrieve the path trace information when the status is "COMPLETED", otherwise is unable to find full path - either status = "FAIL" or script timeout.

####Output walkthrough

1. Display a list of host and network device IPs.
2. User selected sourceIP = 211.2.2.1, destIP = 212.1.10.20.
3. We then passed the selected sourceIP = 211.2.2.1, destIP = 212.1.10.20 to POST /flow-analysis and got "flowAnalysisId" =  "0c438197-44a1-4168-b261-ec9a9eac1703".
4. Use GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId} to monitor the progress of `POST /flow-analysis`.
5. From the "request["status"]" attribute in the response of "GET /flow-analysis/flowAnalysisId" we cam monitor the POST /flow-analysis request status.
6. When the POST /flow-analysis task is done then from the "networkElementsInfo" attribute in the response of "GET /flow-analysis/flowAnalysisId" we can see the routing path started from host 211.2.2.1 and reached CAMPUS-Dist1 with IP=55.1.1.100.  The next hop was CAMPUS-Access1 with IP=212.1.10.1, and finally we  arrive at the host with IP=212.1.10.20, which is the destination.

## Session Summary ##
We learned how to use the `POST /flow-analysis` API to trace a path between two IP addresses. We learned that the "POST /flow-analysis" API is a task-based API that requires use of the `GET  /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` API to check the status of the request.  We used `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` to get the final result of the `POST /flow-analysis` request. These steps match the following main sections of this lab:

* A. POST /flow-analysis
* B. Use GET  /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId} API to monitor POST /flow-analysis request status
* C. We should get either "COMPLETED" or "FAIL" status from `GET /flow-analysis/{flowAnalysisId}` when the task of POST /flow-analysis is finished. If it cannot can the result in 30 seconds script will time out.


Although this example is text-based for the sake of simplicity, what we learned in this session can be used in an application that shows path trace results graphically, like the following example. This screen is from the "Path Trace" application in the Cisco APIC-EM GUI, which uses these very same APIs to do its work.
