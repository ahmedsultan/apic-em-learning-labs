# Lab 5: EasyQoS and related APIs - Policy Preview<font color='red'> New API in GA 1.3</font>

##### We learned how to create a policy and push it into network device. It will be nice if we can see what will be pushed into network device before create/apply policy. In APIC-EM GA 1.3 we actually can do that. This is one of cool features in 1.3.

## Objectives
Learn how to create a policy preview in a plain text format(IOS config).

The steps and JSON object for creating preview is similar to creating policy with additional two attributes **"networkDeviceIds"** and **"state"**. See the following figure.

![Figure](/posts/files/policy/preview.jpg)

Except a new function **get\_file\_with\_id( )**, all other functions are the same as in create policy script - `lab4-1-post-policy.py`. There are mainly used to provide parameters to populate JSON object for `POST policy/preview`. <br> 
The content of preview will be saved in a file and **get\_file\_with\_id( )** function is used to retrieve file content by using `file/{fileId}` API.<br>


* Source code file: lab5-1-policy-preview.py
* To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>

	**Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab5-1-policy-preview.py`<br>
	**Windows:**    `py -3 lab5-1-policy-preview.py` or `python lab5-1-policy-preview.py`<br>
**Code listing - py -3 lab5-1-policy-preview.py**


Here we only show part of script that is new.

##### The following figure shows the response from the ```policy/preview ``` API. 

![Figure](/posts/files/policy/preview_response.jpg)

##### The following code snippet shows how we parse the response from above figure.<br>
* The for loop in line 1 iterates entire "response" attribute. ```preview = response_json["response"]```
* <font color='red'>The for loop in line 2 iterates "policy" attribute</font>
* <font color='blue'>The code in line 3 make sure policy preview is created, we won't see "policyName" if preview is not created.</font>
* <font color='green'>We created many lines of code only for one purpose - to get "fileId". Once we have this id we can use **```GET /file/<id>```** API to retrieve policy preview. We may also get fileId when the status of **```POST policy/preview```** is **```INPROGRESS```** but the preview content maybe incomplete.</font>

### Session Summary ##

This concludes the policy preview lab session. In next lab session we will discuss how to delete Policy Tag, policy Tag Association, Application and Policy after creation.

## What's next?

* **Lab 6: EasyQoS and related APIs - Delete Policy,Custom NBAR2 Application,Policy Tag Association and Policy Tag**
