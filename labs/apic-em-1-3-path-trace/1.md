# APIC-EM REST API Part II - Path Trace


## Objective

Completion Time: 20 minutes

* Learn about the Path Trace APIC-EM APIs
* Write custom scripts using Python


## Prerequisites
* If you are not familiar with APIC-EM APIs we recommend strongly you start from Part I - The Basics
* This Lab is based on the APIC-EM release 1.3.
* The url for API call in "DevNet APIC-EM GA 1.3 always on sandbox" is https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em. This url is used for API call only, not for UI access.
* Python version 3.x is required to run sample scripts.


## Getting Started

If you are using Cisco-provided hardware at a Cisco event:

*  Lab sample code may have already downloaded into working directory: **C:\apicem-1.3-LL-sample-codes\path-trace-labs**
*  If you cannot find downloaded sample codes you can create your working directory by typing "mkdir \apicem-1.3-LL-sample-codes\path-trace-labs\<UniqueName>".<br><br>

If you are working from your own laptop please take the following steps to set up your system:

*  Install Python 3 and Git on your computer. See **How To Set up Your Own Computer** at the top of this page.
*  Download and install Git.  The download URL is **[https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**
*  Download the lab files from GitHub :<br>

  ```
  cd <your working directory>
  ```


If you are in the DevNet Zone at a Cisco Live Event open the Git Command window by either clicking on the 'Git CMD' icon on the Task Bar or in the Run bar type 'git cmd'.  In the git command window type the command below.

```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/apicem-1.3-LL-sample-codes
```
After the git clone completes, you will have all of the Python files that the lab steps use.

*  In order to run the Python scripts outside of a Cisco event, you need to set the **ip** variable to the IP address of the Cisco APIC-EM controller that you want the scripts to call. This variable is in the **apicem_config.py** file.<br>
For example:

 ```
 ip = 'devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'
 ```

## Step 1.  Executing Lab Examples

To execute the scripts, take the following steps:

1. Open a terminal and switch to the directory that holds the learning lab sample code.  Typically, the `apicem-1.3-LL-sample-code\path-trace` is your working directory.
2. Invoke Python3 as appropriate for your OS:<br>

### Running the Python Scripts

  * Mac OS or Linux: **type: python3 programName**
  * Windows: **type: py â€“3 programName**. Or **type: python programName**

>  Alternatively, you can use Python IDE - IDLE.<br> In Mac OS Terminal just type "idle3" that will bring up IDLE for Python3.<br>In Windows you can start IDLE from Start menu. See the following figure.</b><br></font>

###  Sample scripts
All Python sample scripts are working in a flat directory. The **apicem\_config.py** is used for configuring parameters in different environment. Those parameters are APIC-EM IP (including port number), username, password and the apic-em API version number. If you are using your own APIC-EM this is the file you need to modify - **apicem_config.py**. <br>
Script **apicem.py** contains common functions. Every script needs to import apicem.py.

In Part II we will do more structured programming by start using functions.

#### Next Step
The following lab sessions create simple Python applications that interact with the Cisco APIC-EM controller by means of the NB REST API. We recommend strongly that you run the scripts in each lab session to see the live responses from APIC-EM server.

* **Lab 1: Host APIs**
* Lab 2: Path Trace - Flow Analysis APIs
