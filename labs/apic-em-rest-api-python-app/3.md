## Step 3. Writing a Python Script

Now, we will write the code ourselves. We will do it step-by-step, and eventually the code will send an API request to APIC-EM and retrieve an authentication token.


- To make API calls using Python, we need to import two modules: `requests` and `json`.

```python
#Import necessary modules
import requests
import json
```

**Note:** Technically, the JSON module is not required as its functionality is pulled into the `requests` module already. E.g. JSON data can be passed into the POST method by calling `requests.post` with the `json=variable` parameter instead of using `data=json.dumps(variable)`. However, it makes sense for students to understand the function of the json module and its `loads()` and `dumps()` methods.

-  Now, we should be able to call all of the functions we need that are packaged in the modules. Optionally, we can turn off warning messages related to SSL certificates. It can be achieved with the code below.

```python
#Import necessary modules
import requests
import json

#Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()
```

- Below we will define variables which will be used later in our code.

```python
#Import necessary modules
import requests
import json

#Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

# Variables

apic_em_ip = "https://sandboxapic.cisco.com/api/v1"
api_call ="/ticket"
```

- It is time to define our payload, header and parameter information.

```python
#Import necessary modules
import requests
import json

#Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

# Variables

apic_em_ip = "https://sandboxapic.cisco.com/api/v1"
api_call ="/ticket"

#Payload contains authentication information
payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

# Header information
headers = {"content-type" : "application/json"}
```

- The result of our call we will assign to a `response` variable.

```python
#Import necessary modules
import requests
import json

#Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

# Variables
apic_em_ip = "https://sandboxapic.cisco.com/api/v1"
api_call ="/ticket"

#Payload contains authentication information
payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

# Header information
headers = {"content-type" : "application/json"}

# Combine apic_em_ip and api_call variables into one variable call url
url = apic_em_ip + api_call

response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, verify=False)

# Print the respond body
print(response.text)
```


- Our code is ready to be used. We can copy and save it in our working directory as a Python file.
- To see how it works, open command line interface and navigate to the working directory. Then issue `python <FILE-NAME.py>` command. If everything was written correctly then we should see output in our terminal screen.

    As you can see the output is not very readable. Lets change our code, so it would print only information that interests us. To do that:
    1.  Add `.json()` at the end of the `response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, verify=False)` line.

    2.  Replace line `print(response.text)` with `print("Authenticaton Token: " + response["response"]["serviceTicket"])`.

    3.  The code will now only print the value stored in `serviceTicket` key.

- The final code should look like this.

```python
#Import necessary modules
import requests
import json

#Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

# Variables
apic_em_ip = "https://sandboxapic.cisco.com/api/v1"
api_call ="/ticket"

#Payload contains authentication information
payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

# Header information
headers = {"content-type" : "application/json"}

# Combine apic_em_ip and api_call variables into one variable call url
url = apic_em_ip + api_call

response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, verify=False).json()

# Print the Authentication token from the reponse body
print("Authentication Token: ",response["response"]["serviceTicket"])```

Make the changes to the code and run it again. The output will be much cleaner and more readable.

Congratulations! You've written Python code that can make a REST API call and retrieve information from APIC-EM. In the next step, we will build an application which will get the running configuration from a networking device that we've selected from APIC-EM's inventory list and save it to a file.
