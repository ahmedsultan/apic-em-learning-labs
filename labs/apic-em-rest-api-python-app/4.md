## Step 4. The Python Application

In this step, we will build an application which will obtain the running configuration from a networking device and save it to a file. The device will be chosen from APIC-EM's inventory list.

In order for us to make successful API calls we need to know what kind of method to use and what type of information should be provided in the request. For that, we need to review APIC-EM's API documentation accessible via
<http://devnetapic.cisco.com/>

For this particular application we will be mostly using API calls that are group under **Inventory** section. Please take a minute and review its contents.

We are ready to build our application, so let's begin!

- We will start by copying code from the previous step and making it into a function. The first function will take one argument which will be the APIC-EM's URL address and should return an authentication token obtained from the APIC-EM Controller. The returned token will be used by other functions to make the necessary API calls.
```python
def get_token(url):

    api_call ="/ticket"

    #Payload contains authentication information
    payload = { "username": "devnetuser", "password": "Cisco123!" }

    # Header information
    headers = {"content-type" : "application/json"}

    # Combine URL, API call variables
    url +=api_call

    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, verify=False).json()

    # Return authentication token from respond body
    return response["response"]["serviceTicket"]
```

- We will use the values returned from the previous function to get the running configuration of all devices and write each to separate files. To achieve the goal, we will need to create a new function which will take two arguments (authentication token, APIC-EM's URL address) and will query APIC-EM to obtain running configuration for network devices.
```python
def get_config(token, url):

    # Define API Call. To get the network configuration for all devices
    api_call = "/network-device/config"

    # Header information
    headers = {"X-AUTH-TOKEN": token}

    # Combine URL, API call variables
    url += api_call

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False).json()
    count=1
    for data in response['response']:
        filename="access_host_" + str(count) +".txt"
        # Create a file in present working directory
        file = open(filename, 'w')
        # write json data from runningConfig key
        file.write(data['runningConfig'])
        # Close the file when writing is complete
        file.close()
        count+=1
```

- Terrific! All of our functions are created and it is time to put everything together. Our code should look like the following below.


``` python
#import modules
import requests
import json

#Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

# Variables
apic_em_ip = "https://sandboxapic.cisco.com/api/v1"

def get_token(url):

    #Define API Call
    api_call ="/ticket"

    #Payload contains authentication information
    payload = { "username": "devnetuser", "password": "Cisco123!" }

    #Header information
    headers = {"content-type" : "application/json"}

    #Combine URL, API call and parameters variables
    url +=api_call

    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, verify=False).json()

    # Return authentication token from respond body
    return response["response"]["serviceTicket"]



def get_config(token, url):

    # Define API Call. Get configuration for all network devices.    
    api_call = "/network-device/config"

    # Header information
    headers = {"X-AUTH-TOKEN": token}

    # Combine URL, API call variables
    url += api_call

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False).json()
    count=1
    for data in response['response']:
        filename="access_host_" + str(count) +".txt"
        # Create a file in present working directory
        file = open(filename, 'w')       
        # write json data from runningConfig key
        file.write(data['runningConfig'])
        # Close the file when writing is complete
        file.close()
        count+=1

#Assign obtained authentication token to a variable. Provide APIC-EM's URL address
auth_token = get_token(apic_em_ip)

#Call get_config() function to obtain and write each network device's configuration to a separate file.
#Provide authentication token, APIC-EM's URL address
get_config(auth_token, apic_em_ip)

```

- Copy the above code and save it as a Python file.

- Open a terminal window and navigate to your directory where the Python code is saved.  Start the application by issuing `python <FILE-NAME.py>`.  In OS X or Linux type: `python3 <FILE-NAME.py>`. If everything was done correctly you should see a new prompt in the terminal screen. It means there were no errors while executing the code.

- Now, in the terminal window check the folder contents again. You should see several new files titled `access_host_##.txt`. Where **##** is the file number.  These files were created by our application.

- To check the file contents open the text file using your favorite text editor or print the contents of the file in the terminal window. We will use a text editor to check the contents of the file.

- Wonderful! Our application is working!


### Improving the Application

Instead of naming the output files `access_host_##.txt`, a better practice would be to give the name of our file the hostname of the device from which the configuration was obtained, and append date and time to the filename to show when the configuration was saved. This way backup files containing the configurations of the entire network can be created within seconds and used as a change control mechanism to see what was changed on a particular device at a given time.

To implement this idea we need to slightly modify our code.

1. We need to import two new modules called `datetime` and `re`. The **re** module will help us to capture the hostname of the device and the **datetime** module will provide the current date and time, so we can append a timestamp to the filename.
```python
#Import necessary modules
import requests
import json
import datetime
import re
```
2. We need to modify the `get_config()` function, so it will capture the hostname of each device and change the filename to our desired format for each. Capturing the hostname of the device can done in multiple ways, but creating a regular expression is the fastest and most convenient way. The modified function should look like this:
```python
def get_config2(token, url):

    # Define API Call. To get specific device's configuration
    # we will need to add device's ID in the API call
    api_call = "/network-device/config"

    # Header information
    headers = {"X-AUTH-TOKEN": token}

    # Combine URL, API call variables
    url += api_call

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False).json()

    for data in response['response']:
        #Find the hostname in the response body and save it to a hostname variable
        hostname = re.findall('hostname\s(.+?)\s', data['runningConfig'])[0]

        #Create a date_time variable which will hold current time
        date_time = datetime.datetime.now()

        #Create a variable which will hold the hostname combined with the date and time
        #The format will be hostname_year_month_day_hour.minute.second
        filename = hostname + '_' + str(date_time.year) + '_' + str(date_time.month) + '_' + str(date_time.day) + '_' + str(date_time.hour) + '.' + str(date_time.minute) + '.' + str(date_time.second)

        # Create a file in present working directory
        file = open(filename, 'w')       
        file.write(data['runningConfig'])
        # Close the file when writing is complete
        file.close()
```
3. Now make the necessary modifications in your python script and run the code again.   Let's view the newly created list of files.

Congratulations! You just wrote an application that backs up device configurations.
