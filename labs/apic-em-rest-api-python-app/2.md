## Step 2. Generating Code Using Postman

Previously in Learning Lab module <a href="https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/devnet-express-np-rest-python" target="_blank">REST APIs and Python</a> we explained how to make API requests using the Postman application. Now we will show how to generate code for different software programming languages using Postman. For this step, we will use the Python language option offered by the application.

We assume that you already have the Postman application and Python installed on your workstation and know how to use each. If you system is not set up, please follow the steps in the **How to Set up Your Own Computer** section at the top of this page.

To generate code, we need to populate the relevant fields in Postman. Lets begin.

1. From your workstation open Postman application.

2. First, we need to obtain authentication token from APIC-EM in order to make future API calls. To do that we need to set the method to `POST` and URL to `https://sandboxapic.cisco.com/api/v1/ticket`

3. Next, we need to define request headers information. Click on the headers tab and provide one key value pairs.
	* `Content-Type` and `application/json`

4. Finally, to get the authentication token we need to provide a username and a password information. Click on the body tab and select the `raw` option. In the window  below paste the following information (this will be sent as the data of the POST):

	```
	{
	"username" : "devnetuser",
	"password" : "Cisco123!"
	}
	```

5. Make sure that everything works and the provided information is correct by clicking the 'Send' button. You should receive a valid token and 200/OK as the result.

6. Good! We are now ready to generate the code using Postman. Under the `Save` button you should find the `Generate Code` or `Code` link. Click on it. In the **Generate Code Snippets** window click on the down arrow of the drop down menu and select 'Python -> Requests'.

7. Now the entries are converted to Python code using the `requests` module to make the API call. Click `Copy to Clipboard` button to copy the code.  Note that the added header keys: cache-control and postman-token are specific to POSTMAN and can be either removed or ignored.

8. Paste the contents of the clipboard to your favorite text editor and save it as a Python file in your working directory.

9. Lets give it a try and see if it works. Open the command line terminal and navigate to your working directory. For Windows issue `python <FILE-NAME.py>` command.  On OS X or Linux type:`python3 <FILE-NAME.py>`  You should see a response from the APIC-EM Controller.

10. If you received an SSL error add "Verify=False" to the request function call and run the script again.

Terrific! You just learned how to generate code using Postman. In the next section of this lab we will show how to write the code yourself.
