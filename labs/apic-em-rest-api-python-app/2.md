## Step 2. Generating Code Using Postman

Previously, in <a href="https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/devnet-express-np-rest-python" target="_blank">REST APIs and Python</a>, you saw how to make API requests using the Postman application. Now, you learn how to use Postman to generate code, and then run that code to make API calls. In this example, you generate Python code. However, with Postman, you can use the same approach to generate code in various other languages.

If you don't already have Postman and Python3 installed, please follow the steps in the **How to Set up Your Computer** topic, whose link is at the top of this page.

This example shows you how to get an authentication token, also called a *ticket*, from the APIC-EM controller. This type of token is required to authenticate calls to every API other than `/v1/ticket`. Because you'll perform a similar call in the next step, you don't need to keep the tokens you generate during the following steps.

Make the API call using Postman:

1. Open Postman.

2. Set the method to `POST` and URL to `https://sandboxapic.cisco.com/api/v1/ticket`.

3. Click the **Headers** tab and enter the following key-value pair.
	* `Content-Type` and `application/json`

4. Click the **Body** tab and select the `raw` option.

5. Paste the username and password key-value pairs into the window, as shown.

	```
	{
	"username" : "devnetuser",
	"password" : "Cisco123!"
	}
	```

6. Click the **Send** button.

7. If you set up the request correctly, the APIC-EM controller returns `200/OK`, and Postman displays `200/OK` in the results. If so, click the **Save** button.

Good! Now, use Postman to generate the code and use it to make the same API call:

1. Under the `Save` button, click the `Code` link.

2. In the **Generate Code Snippets** window that opens, use the drop down menu to select 'Python -> Requests'. This action converts the request to python code that you can use to make the API call.

3. Click `Copy to Clipboard` button.  

Note: In the `headers`, you can remove or ignore the Postman-specific `cache-control` and `postman-token` key-value pairs.

4. Paste the clipboard to a text editor and save it as a Python file (`.py`) in your working directory.

5. Open a terminal and navigate to your working directory.

6. Run the python code. For Windows, enter `python <FILE-NAME.py>`.  For Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 <FILE-NAME.py>`.  The terminal should display the response from the APIC-EM Controller.

7. If the request produced an SSL error, add "Verify=False" to the request function call, as shown here, and run the script again.

Good! You learned how to use Postman to generate code and used that code to make an API call. Next, you learn how to code an API call without using Postman.
