# APIC-EM REST API

APIC-EM's Northbound (NB) REST-based API allows Network Engineers and Operators to communicate with the controller using custom built applications to respond more rapidly to changing network conditions and related business opportunities.

The APIC-EM southbound interface speaks to the network's control plane and is not directly accessible. It is used to execute commands on the underlying networking devices that were specified via the Northbound (NB) REST API. Thus, applications can be written to communicate with APIC-EM and add dynamic SDN functionality directly into the network.

This lab demonstrates usage of the Cisco APIC-EM Northbound REST API via the Python programming language.

## Objective ##

Completion Time: 35 minutes

* Learn how to use Postman REST Client to generate Python code
* Write custom scripts using Python


## Prerequisites

* In this module, we are going to use <a href="https://www.getpostman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a> which is a Google Chrome Browser application to make the REST API calls and <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python3</a> as the programming language.

* Please click on the box above "How to Set up Your Computer" for more information.

**Access to an APIC-EM Controller**

- To interface with APIC-EM you will need access to an APIC-EM controller.
- If you do not already have a running APIC-EM Controller you may use an APIC-EM Controller provided by the <a href=""https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology target="_blank">Cisco DevNet Sandbox.</a>
	- We will use the Always-on APIC-EM Sandbox located at [https://sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com)
  - The login credentials for the controller are **username:** devnetuser and **password:** Cisco123!


## Step 1. Connect to APIC-EM

Open your web browser and navigate to [https://sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com) web page. If an SSL Certification warning page is displayed you will need to bypass the warning. To proceed click on the **Advanced** button then click on the **Proceed to sandboxapic.cisco.com** link.

On the login page, use **username:** devnetuser and **password:** Cisco123! to authenticate.

If you are using Postman on a Mac computer, then also check that SSL verification is turned off.
1. In Postman click on the **Wrench** icon then from the drop down menu select **Settings**.

<br/>
<br/>
2. In the popup window under the **General** tab assure that SSL certificate verification is turned off.  If you don't see this option, don't worry about it and close the window.

Next, we will generate Python code using the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> application.
